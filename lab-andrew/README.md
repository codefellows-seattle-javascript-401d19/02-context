The exported module from fp.js is an object with 4 functions attached. The functions are map, filter, reduce and slice. Each function takes an array as a parameter, as well as additional parameters. Map filter and reduce take callback functions, reduce takes an initial value, and slice takes a start and end value. Map will only take numbers as input into the array, and will return an error if anything else is passed in. Filter has essentially the same input validation as map. I set up reduce to only function with an array of numbers as inputs, although, broadly speaking, reduce can be used in other cases. The accumulator (initialValue) is forced in this case to be a number also. The only input validation I did for slice, was to make sure that if a parameter for start or end was passed in, that it was a number. I parsed that in my code to make sure it was an integer and not a float. Also, the array must not be empty. The start of the slice function must not be greater than the length of the array. There was more validation that could have been implemented, but it started to get a lot more complex, and the functionality present seems sufficient.
