# Lab 02: Tools and Context

In fp.js the exported module is an object with the following methods attached: fp.map, fp.filter, fp.reduce, and fp.slice. The fp.map function has an arity of two (callback and collection), the callback being a callback function that is tested in fp.test.js and collection being an array. The fp.filter function also has an arity of two (callback and collection), which are the callback function and the array. For both of these functions the arrays will only accept numbers as values and will otherwise return an error. The fp.reduce function has an arity of three (callback, collection, and initialState), which are the callback function, an array, and the starting value. In this case, the fp.reduce function only accepts numbers as values in the array. It will otherwise return an error. I also added an if statement so that initialState must also be a number. The fp.slice function has an arity of three (collection, begin, and end), which is the array, and the begin and end integers as are pertinent to the .slice functionality. If the array is empty, it will throw an error.
